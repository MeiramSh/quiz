Definitions

The light originating from a fluorescent point source (object) travels though
the optics of the microscope, including the objective lens and it is 
diffracted. What is the image of the point source at the focal plane


Three tenets of the cell theory: 
1. The cell is the basic unit of life
2. All organisms are composed of cells
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells


Airy disk is the three-dimensional diffraction image of the point source.

Numerical Aperture is determined by the refractive index n of
the medium filling the space between the sample and the lens
and the half collection angle of light θ (a)
NA = n sin(θ)
